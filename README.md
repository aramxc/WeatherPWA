# Simple Progressive Native React Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Goal

My aim with this project is to familiarize myself with React while brushing up on some basic web development skills! Over the years I've taught myself how to code, going from static HTML and CSS web pages to learning object oriented programming with Java and now Python. 

I'm starting with a very simple weather application here and with time I hope to add other features as I learn new skills. Ideally I'll make use of relational databases to demonstrate a basic understanding of data manipulation in a web based application! 

## Future Implementation Ideas

After creating the basic web interface showing the user local weather data, I'd love to be able to incorporate other data streams to provide the user with other data as well. Current ideas include using population density data, Covid19 case data, etc. I don't want to stop at just weather!
