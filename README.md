# Simple Progressive Native React Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Goals

My aim with this project is to familiarize myself with React while brushing up on some basic web development skills and git workflow! Over the years I've taught myself how to code, going from static HTML and CSS web pages to learning object oriented programming with Java and now Python. 

I'm starting with a very simple weather application here and with time I hope to add other features as I learn new skills. Ideally I'll make use of relational databases to demonstrate a basic understanding of data manipulation in a web based application! 

Another concept I want to get comfortable with is PWA's (Progressive Web Application's). In this project, I learned about service workers - code that allows an application to load stored data if the user is not connected to the internet.

## Cloud Based Hosting with Heroku

I also wanted to learn more about Heroku. Heroku is a cloud based platform that allows developers to build, run, and operate applications remotely. 

## Future Implementation Ideas

After creating the basic web interface showing the user local weather data, I'd love to be able to incorporate other data streams to provide the user with other data as well. Current ideas include using population density data, Covid19 case data, etc. I don't want to stop at just weather!

## API

For this project I used the free OpenWeather API for all weather data

## HTML and CSS 

Most of the style sheets and HTML code were obtained through a code tutorial from Adrian Hajdin, his source code can be found on his personal github account https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_weather_pwa
